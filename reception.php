					<p>District 9 has grossed over $210 million dollars, making 7 times the amount in which was put in it for production budget, at $30 million.
					It opened on August 14, 2009 in the United States as well as Canada, and during its first weeking of airing it was ranked first in the weekend box office, holding an opening gross of $37,354,308. Comparing it to similar films that came out around the same time, District 9 did not have as large of a weekend audience as did Cloverfield which came out in 2008 and Startship Troopers which came out in 1997. The film stood out as a summer film that generated strong business despite little-known casting. Its opening success was attributed to the studio's unusual marketing campaign.<br/> In the film's second weekend, it dropped 49% in revenue while competing against the opening film Inglourious Basterds for the male audience, as Sony Pictures attributed the "good hold" to District 9's strong playability.
					The film enjoyed similar success in the UK with an opening gross of Â£2,288,378.<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9#Box_office' style='top: 0px; text-align: right; display: block; padding-right: 10px; color:#DFE0AF;'>Paraphrased from - Wikipedia</a></p>

					<p>The film received critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 90%, meaning it got positive reviews by 90% of reviewers, based on a sample of 261.. The website wrote of the consensus, "Technically brilliant and emotionally wrenching, District 9 has action, imagination, and all the elements of a thoroughly entertaining science-fiction classic." <br/><br/>Metacritic, another review aggregate website that assigns an average out of 100 from mainstream critics weighted District 9 at an 81 based on 36 reviews.<br/><br/>
					The International Movies Database, IMDB, has rated District 9 an 8/10.<br/><br/>
					
					"Sara Vilkomerson of The New York Observer wrote, 'District 9 is the most exciting science fiction movie to come along in ages; definitely the most thrilling film of the summer; and quite possibly the best film I've seen all year.' Christy Lemire from the Associated Press was impressed by the plot and thematic content, claiming that 'District 9 has the aesthetic trappings of science fiction but it's really more of a character drama, an examination of how a man responds when he's forced to confront his identity during extraordinary circumstances.' Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum described it as '... madly original, cheekily political, [and] altogether exciting ...'"

				<p>There was some controversy revolving around the use of Nigerians as cannibalistic criminals. At first, Nigeria's Information Minister Dora Akunyili simply asked movie theatres in Nigeria to edit out parts with references to Nigeria or to not show the movie at all. There were a series of letters sent to the director and producer of the movie from Nigerian officials and citizens alike complaining about the movie and calling it insulting. <br/> Eventually the film was forcefully banned instead of suggested to be banned in Nigeria, and the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board was asked to prevent cinemas from showing the film and also to confiscate it.
