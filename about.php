	            	<p>"Director Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It's been 28 years	since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from the skies,	nor	any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our society.	Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa set up	a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to	handle the situation. <br/><br/>As the humans begin to grow wary of the
					unwelcome intruders, a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the	aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to
					fund their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate, the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is	the key to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most
					wanted man on the planet..<span style='text-align: center; display: block;

					<p>The setting of District 9 is inspired by historical events that took place in South Africa during the apartheid era. The films title loosely references District Six, a Cape-Town residential area in South Africe that was declared a "whites only" area in 1966, with 60,000 people removed to Cape Flatts. The film also refers to contemporary evictions and forced removals to new suburban ghettos in post-apartheid South Africa as well as the resistance of its residents.<br/><br/>
					The films irony of Wikus becoming more humane as his becomes less human shows the statement made about inhumanity. Chris Mikesell a reporter for a Hawaii newspaper, Ka Leo, notes that inhumanity is a deep-rooted theme throughout. He writes: "Substitute 'black,' 'Asian,' 'Mexican,' 'illegal,' 'Jew,' or any number of different labels for the word 'prawn' in this film and you will hear the hidden truth behind the dialogue". <br/><br/>
					Speciesism towards the aliens is supposed to show the movies themes of racism and xenophobia. Duane Dudek from the Journal Sentinel wrote that "The result is an action film about xenophobia, in which all races of humans are united in their dislike and mistrust of an insect-like species".<br/><br/>
					Another theme within District 9 is a reliance on corporations that are not tied down to any one country as a governments source of military power. MNU being negatively portrayed is a statement about the dangers out miltary outsourcing to the private sector.<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9#Themes' style='top: 0px; text-align: right; display: block; padding-right: 10px; color:#DFE0AF;'>Paraphrased from - Wikipedia</a></p>
