					<p>Originally, the producer Producer Peter Jackson was supposed to work on a film adaptation of the wildly popular "Halo" video-game franchise. Due to budget concerns and lack of financing, the "Halo" movie has yet to see the light of day, and instead Peter Jackson when on to help Blomkamp create District 9.<br/><br/> Previously, Blomkamp had only directed small things such as commercials and short films, and thus District 9 would be his first full feature film. He co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell and chose to film in South Africa, where he was born. In the movie, he and Tatchell decided to return to the same setting as was in Blomkamps short film "Alive in Joburg" choosing characters, moments and concepts that they found interesting including the documentary style filmmaking, staged interviews, alien designs, alien technology/mecha suits, and the parallels to racial conflict and segregation in South Africa, and fleshing out these elements for the feature film.<br/><br/>
					The financing was done fully by QED International, underwriting the negative cost prior to American Film Market (AFM) 2007. At AFM 2007, QED entered into a distribution deal with Sony's TriStar Pictures for North America and other English-language territories, Korea, Italy, Russia and Portugal.<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9#Development' style='top: 0px; text-align: right; display: block; padding-right: 10px; color:#DFE0AF;'>Paraphrased from - Wikipedia</a></p>

					<p>The film was shot on location in Chiawelo, Soweto. The actual location protrayed in District 9 is an actual neighborhood that is impoverished and is a place where people are actually experiencing forced relocation into housing that is government-subsidized.<br/><br/>
					District 9 was shot mainly during the winter in South Africa, in the June-July months. According to director Neill Blomkamp, during the winter season, Johannesburg "actually looks like Chernobyl", a "nuclear apocalyptic wasteland". The director wished to have an image of a bleak slightly semi-apocalyptic world, thus why he chose to film during the winter months. The film, in total, took 60 days to completely shoot.<br/><br/>
					According to Blomkamp there was not any singular film that influenced his decisions in writing, directing, and shooting District 9. He did however attribue many old 1980's "hardcore sci-fi/action" films as potential ubconscious influences, such as the Alien(s) movies and the Terminator movies. He said, "I don't know whether the film has that feeling or not for the audience, but I wanted it to have that harsh 1980s kind of vibe — I didn't want it to feel glossy and slick."<br/><br/>
					Due to the large amount of shooting that had to be done by hand held in the film, the producers/crew make the decision to use the digital Red One camera to shoot the footage. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch used nine digital Red Ones owned by Peter Jackson for primary filming.<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9#Filming' style='top: 0px; text-align: right; display: block; padding-right: 10px; color:#DFE0AF;'>Paraphrased from - Wikipedia</a></p>

					<p>As a child growing up in South Africa, the director Blomkamp had shown interest in the possibilities of artwork and visual effects. “I knew I wanted to be in movies… So I thought I wanted to be in special effects, like model-making and prosthetic effects." In combination with the knowledge that he wanted to be a part of the film industry alongide the growing technological development of visual effects technologies, Blomkamp got a job at a post-production company based out of Canada. The aliens in District 9 were designed by Weta Workshop, and the design was executed by Image Engine.<br/><br/>
					Blomkamp wanted the aliens in his feel to take on both a sort of humanistic feel to them as well as a barbaric feel. He did this by incorporating barbaric looks to the aliens while having them have human behaviors and emotions. According to his co-writer Terri Tatchell, “They are not appealing, they are not cute, and they don’t tug at our heartstrings. He went for a scary, hard, warrior-looking alien, which is much more of a challenge.” The alien's look, with its exoskeleton-crustacean hybrid and crab-like shells, was initially meant to disgust the viewers of the movie but eventually the viewer were to grow to liking the alien creatures regardless of the way they looked, and sympathize with them since they had human emotions and characteristics. <br/><br/>
					Originally, Weta Studios was going to be Blomkamps go-to for creature design, but at the time of filming they were busy working on Avatar. The director then sought the help of a Vancouver-based effects company.Blomkamp met with Image Engine considering them "a bit of a gamble" since the company had not previously done effects for a feature film . Aside from the aliens appearing on the operating table in the medical lab, all of them were created using CGI visual effects. Weta did end up helping design some other parts of the movie, including the 2.5 km diameter mothership and the drop ship, while the exo-suit and the little pets were designed by The Embassy Visual Effects. Zoic Studios performed overflow 2D work. On-set live special effects were created by MXFX.<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_9#Visual_Effects' style='top: 0px; text-align: right; display: block; padding-right: 10px; color:#DFE0AF;'>Paraphrased from - Wikipedia</a></p>
